Yes, this is a great start, and you're definitely on the right track with practicing OOP! For a 3-file Tic Tac Toe game, this is a very reasonable structure.

Let's break down your code file by file and then discuss the project as a whole. I will tell you what you did well and areas where you could improve to strengthen your OOP and Ruby skills.

**Review of `main.rb`:**

```ruby
require_relative 'lib/player'
require_relative 'lib/board'

def play
  board = Board.new
  player_x = Player.new('ali', 'O', board, true)
  player_o = Player.new('bob', 'X', board, false)
  for i in 0..8 do
    if player_x.is_active == true && board.break_loop == false
      player_x.draw_on_board
      player_x.is_active = false
      player_o.is_active = true
    elsif player_o.is_active == true && board.break_loop == false
      player_o.draw_on_board
      player_x.is_active = true
      player_o.is_active = false

    end
  end
end

play
```

**What you did well in `main.rb`:**

- **Clear Entry Point:** The `play` method clearly sets up the game and starts it, which is good for readability.
- **Object Instantiation:** You correctly create instances of `Board` and `Player` classes, demonstrating the basic concept of object creation.
- **Player Setup:** You initialize two players with names, markers, and assign them to the board, which is a logical setup for a two-player game.
- **Turn-Based Logic (Basic):** You have a basic implementation for alternating turns between players using the `is_active` flag and a `for` loop to control the game flow for a maximum of 9 turns (which is the maximum in Tic Tac Toe).

**Areas for Improvement in `main.rb`:**

- **Game Loop Control:** The `for i in 0..8` loop is a bit rigid. Tic Tac Toe games don't always go to 9 turns (they can end sooner if someone wins). It's better to control the game loop based on the game state (e.g., until someone wins or the board is full). The `board.break_loop` is a step towards this, but the `for` loop still dictates the maximum turns.
- **Turn Switching Logic:** The `if/elsif` block for switching turns, while functional, can be a bit more concise and potentially moved to a more appropriate place (perhaps a `Game` class or within the `Board` class). Managing `is_active` directly like this in `main.rb` makes `main.rb` responsible for turn management, which might be better encapsulated elsewhere.
- **Lack of Game End Condition (Draw):** While you check for a win condition in `Board`, there is no explicit check or handling for a draw (when the board is full and no one has won) in `main.rb`. The loop will just complete after 9 iterations, potentially leaving the game state unclear if it's a draw.
- **Procedural Feel in `play`:** While you are using objects, the `play` function itself feels a bit procedural. It's more like a script that orchestrates the game rather than a truly object-oriented approach where objects themselves might manage more of the game flow. Consider if a separate `Game` class could encapsulate the game logic more effectively.

**Review of `board.rb`:**

```ruby
class Board
  attr_reader :break_loop

  def initialize
    @board = [['*', '*', '*'], ['*', '*', '*'], ['*', '*', '*']]
    @break_loop = false
  end

  def print_board
    @board.each do |element|
      p element
    end
  end

  def try_to_draw(index, mark)
    if index.between?(0, 8)
      if index.between?(0, 2) and @board[0][index] == '*'
        @board[0][index] = mark
        print_board
        check_if_won(mark)
      elsif index.between?(3, 5) and @board[1][index - 3] == '*'
        @board[1][index - 3] = mark
        print_board
        check_if_won(mark)
      elsif index.between?(6, 8) and @board[2][index - 6] == '*'
        @board[2][index - 6] = mark
        print_board
        check_if_won(mark)
      else
        fix_player_input(mark)
      end
    else
      puts 'bro! pick between 0 and 8'
      correct_number = gets.chomp.to_i
      try_to_draw(correct_number, mark)
    end
  end

  def fix_player_input(mark)
    puts 'Occupied, enter a new cell index'
    print_board
    new_index = gets.chomp.to_i
    try_to_draw(new_index, mark)
  end

  def check_if_won(mark)
    winning_combos = [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6]]
    flat_board = @board.flatten
    # for each element in winning_combo array. take a combo(element) and do this for it :
    #     assign v1, v2, v3 variables to the value of each combo after it has been mapped (v1 = combo after mapping) ->
    #     The mapping here takes a value from combo array then preforms this code : `flat_board[value]` which is only X or O
    #     last , compare if each of v1, v2, v3 is equal to each other, if they are then say that the player has won .
    winning_combos.each do |combo|
      v1, v2, v3 = combo.map { |value| flat_board[value] }
      # Check if all are the same and not empty
      if v1 != '*' && v1 == v2 && v2 == v3
        puts "#{mark} has won"
        @break_loop = true
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**What you did well in `board.rb`:**

- **Encapsulation of Board State:** The `@board` instance variable neatly encapsulates the state of the Tic Tac Toe board within the `Board` class.
- **`print_board` Method:** Having a method to print the board is good for separating concerns and making the board's representation manageable.
- **`try_to_draw` Method:** This method is central to handling player moves and includes input validation (checking if the index is within range and if the cell is empty), which is important.
- **`check_if_won` Method:** The logic for checking winning combinations is well-implemented and clearly understandable. Using `winning_combos` and flattening the board to check against these is a good approach.
- **`@break_loop` Attribute:** Using `@break_loop` to signal the end of the game from within the `Board` class is a reasonable way to communicate game-ending conditions back to the game loop.
- **`attr_reader :break_loop`:** Exposing `break_loop` with a reader is appropriate as `main.rb` needs to check this condition.

**Areas for Improvement in `board.rb`:**

- **Complexity in `try_to_draw`:** The `try_to_draw` method is a bit long and has nested `if/elsif` conditions. While it works, it can be made more readable and maintainable. You're essentially mapping a 1D index (0-8) to a 2D grid. This mapping logic could be extracted or simplified.
- **Input Validation and Error Handling in `try_to_draw` & `fix_player_input`:**
  - **Recursion:** `fix_player_input` calls `try_to_draw` again, which can lead to recursion. While unlikely to cause stack overflow in Tic Tac Toe, recursion for input validation can sometimes be less clear and harder to debug than iterative approaches.
  - **Redundant Input Request:** When an invalid index (outside 0-8) is given, it prints "bro! pick between 0 and 8" and then _immediately_ asks for input again using `gets.chomp.to_i` within the `else` block. This can be slightly confusing to the user if they just entered an out-of-range number.
  - **`fix_player_input` Name:** The name `fix_player_input` isn't the most descriptive. It's more about "handle invalid move (occupied cell)".
- **Responsibility of `print_board`:** Calling `print_board` directly within `try_to_draw` makes the `Board` class responsible for _both_ updating the board state _and_ printing it. In some designs, it might be preferable to separate these concerns. For instance, `try_to_draw` could just update the board and return a success/failure status, and the printing could be handled by the `Player` or a separate "Game Display" component.
- **No Draw Check in `check_if_won`:** `check_if_won` only checks for wins. It doesn't determine if the game is a draw (board full, no winner). You would need to add a check for a draw condition.

**Review of `player.rb`:**

```ruby
class Player
  attr_accessor :is_active

  def initialize(name, marker, board, is_active)
    @board = board
    @name = name
    @marker = marker
    @is_active = is_active
  end

  def draw_on_board
    puts 'where do you want to draw ? choose between 0 and 8 !'
    where = gets.chomp.to_i
    @board.try_to_draw(where, @marker)
  end
end
```

**What you did well in `player.rb`:**

- **Player Class:** Creating a `Player` class is a good OOP approach to represent players with their attributes (name, marker, active status) and actions.
- **`attr_accessor :is_active`:** Using `attr_accessor` to manage the `is_active` state is appropriate if you intend to change this state from outside the `Player` class (which you are doing in `main.rb`).
- **`draw_on_board` Method:** This method encapsulates the player's action of making a move. It handles getting input from the player and delegating the actual board update to the `Board` class using `try_to_draw`. This is a good example of delegation of responsibility.

**Areas for Improvement in `player.rb`:**

- **Tight Coupling to `Board`:** The `Player` class is directly coupled to the `Board` class via the `@board` instance variable and by directly calling `@board.try_to_draw`. While in Tic Tac Toe this is fine, in more complex scenarios, tighter coupling can sometimes make classes less reusable and harder to test in isolation. Consider if there are ways to reduce this direct dependency if the project were to become larger. (For Tic Tac Toe, this level of coupling is acceptable).
- **`draw_on_board` Name:** The name `draw_on_board` is slightly misleading. The `Player` isn't actually drawing on the board itself. It's more like "making a move" or "choosing a cell". A name like `make_move` or `choose_cell` might be more accurate.
- **Input Request in `draw_on_board`:** Similar to `Board`'s `print_board`, having the `Player` class handle the `puts 'where do you want to draw ...'` and `gets.chomp.to_i` for input is okay. However, consider if input/output (IO) operations should be handled by a separate part of the application, especially in larger projects. For a simple Tic Tac Toe game, this level of responsibility in `Player` is reasonable.

**Overall Project - Good Points:**

- **OOP Structure:** You've successfully used classes (`Board`, `Player`) to organize your code, which is a fundamental aspect of OOP.
- **Separation of Concerns (Basic):** You've started to separate concerns. `Board` manages the board state and game logic, `Player` represents the player and their actions, and `main.rb` sets up and runs the game.
- **Functionality:** The game seems to function correctly in terms of turn alternation, marking the board, and checking for wins.
- **Readability (Generally):** The code is reasonably readable and understandable for a Tic Tac Toe game.

**Overall Project - Areas for Improvement (OOP and Ruby Practices):**

- **Game Class (Missing):** Consider introducing a `Game` class to orchestrate the game flow, manage turns, check for game over conditions (win or draw), and potentially handle player setup. This would make `main.rb` cleaner and more focused on just _starting_ the game. It would also encapsulate the game logic more effectively.
- **Refine Object Responsibilities:** Review the responsibilities of each class. Is the `Board` class doing too much? Could some logic be moved to a `Game` class or other classes? For example, turn management might be a responsibility of a `Game` class, not just flags in `Player` and logic in `main.rb`.
- **Reduce Procedural Code:** Aim to reduce procedural code in `main.rb` and potentially within methods. Think about how objects can interact and manage the game state and flow more autonomously.
- **Input/Output (IO) Separation:** While acceptable in this project, for more complex applications, consider separating input and output operations from core game logic. This makes testing and potentially changing the UI (e.g., from command-line to a GUI) easier.
- **Error Handling and Input Validation:** Improve input validation in `Board` (and potentially in `Player`). Consider more robust error handling instead of just `puts` messages. Think about how to gracefully handle invalid input and guide the user.
- **Draw Condition:** Implement a check for a draw game.
- **Code Clarity and Readability:** Look for opportunities to make code more concise and readable (e.g., in `try_to_draw`). Use more descriptive method and variable names where appropriate.
- **Testing (Not in your code, but important for OOP):** As you learn more OOP, think about how you would test your classes in isolation (e.g., test the `Board` class independently from `Player`). Well-designed OOP code is easier to test.

**Shall we continue to discuss specific areas in more detail, or would you like me to suggest some code refactoring examples based on these points?** Let me know what direction you'd like to take! You've done a good job for a practice project, and these are just suggestions for further learning and improvement! 😊
