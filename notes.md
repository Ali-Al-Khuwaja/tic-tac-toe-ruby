First we bundle init

Every ruby project should have gemfile.lock and gemfile and .ruby-version

> Think about how you would set up the different elements within the game… What should be a class? Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.

How the fuck should I use oop with tic tac toe ? I need to ignore the JS way 😮‍💨

In this game we have two players hmmm
player class ?
each player has a name and a role in the game , either X or O
methods ?
draw methods

The board object where player make change to it

OK
player object
has name
has undefined role until it is defined
draw method
draw talks with board
Board object
can be spoken to


start
pick marker for the first player 
pick marker for the second player 
play 9 rounds , in each round do 
    take input = X or O and Coordinates 
    signal to board the arguments 
    board changes and prints
    start new round 


the OOP workflow
